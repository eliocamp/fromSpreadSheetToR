#### Using RStudio Cloud

If you want to use RStudio Cloud you will need a free account. Go to [rstudio.cloud/](https://rstudio.cloud/) and follow de instructions. Keep in mind that the free account has a 15 hours per month restrictions and you don't want to use it all before the workshop.

We'll provide a link to a pre-configured RStudio project during the workshop. You don't have to do anything else.

When we can everything installed we'll ask you to install a few packages to work during the workshop.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

4. Go to File -> New File -> R Markdown. Click on "Ok" to create a new file. RStudio will ask your permission to install several packages. Go ahead and do it.
